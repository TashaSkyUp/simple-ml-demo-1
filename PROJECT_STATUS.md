  - Custom drag handles (⋮⋮) for clear interaction points
  - Real-time validation during layer reordering
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Prevention of invalid layer sequences

### 2. 3D Reshape Layer Implementation
- **Status**: ✅ Fully Implemented
- **Features**:
  - Complete TensorFlow.js integration with `tf.layers.reshape()`
  - Interactive UI with separate Height/Width/Channels input fields
  - Real-time dimension validation and compatibility checking
  - Preset configuration buttons (28×28×1, 14×14×8, 7×7×16)
  - Visual feedback system (green/red indicators)
  - Element count verification to prevent tensor shape mismatches
  - Comprehensive error messaging for invalid configurations

### 3. React Key Duplication Fix
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Issue**: Duplicate React keys causing rendering warnings
- **Solution**: Implemented robust unique ID generation system
  - Custom `generateUniqueId()` function combining timestamp and counter
  - Collision-resistant ID generation for all layer components
  - Applied to both initial layer creation and dynamic layer addition

### 4. TypeScript Error Resolution
- **Status**: ✅ Resolved
- **Fixes Applied**:
  - Added missing React type definitions (`@types/react`, `@types/react-dom`)
  - Fixed undefined object access in DataCollection component
  - Added proper null checking with optional chaining operators
  - Improved type safety throughout the codebase

## 🏗️ Architecture Improvements

### Layer Management System
```typescript
// Robust ID generation prevents duplicate keys
let idCounter = 0;
const generateUniqueId = (): number => {
  return Date.now() * 1000 + idCounter++;
};
```

### Reshape Layer Validation
```typescript
const validateReshapeCompatibility = (targetShape: number[]) => {
  const totalElements = targetShape.reduce((acc, dim) => acc * dim, 1);
  const commonCompatibleSizes = [784, 392, 196, 98, 49];
  
  return {
    isValid: commonCompatibleSizes.includes(totalElements),
    message: `Compatible: ${totalElements} elements`
  };
};
```

### TensorFlow.js Integration
```typescript
case LayerType.Reshape:
  const reshapeConfig = layerConfig as ReshapeLayerConfig;
  newModel.add(
    tf.layers.reshape({ targetShape: reshapeConfig.targetShape })
  );
  break;
```
