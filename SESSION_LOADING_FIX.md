# Session Loading Fix - Test Guide

## 🎯 **Issue Fixed**
**Problem**: After saving and loading a session, the model becomes "unloaded" and live inference stops working, requiring a website refresh.

**Solution**: Fixed model state restoration, proper timing of weight loading, and training state persistence.

## 🧪 **How to Test the Fix**

### Step 1: Train a Model
1. Visit https://tashaskyup.github.io/simple-ml-demo-1/
2. Add some training data by drawing in both class "0" and class "1"
3. Train the model for a few epochs
4. Verify live inference works by drawing in the inference canvas

### Step 2: Save Session
1. Click "Save Session" button in the Training tab
2. Download the session file (e.g., `cnn_session_2024-06-30T13-45-30.json`)
3. Note the success message showing architecture, training data, and weights

### Step 3: Test Session Loading
1. **Option A**: Refresh the page to simulate starting fresh
2. **Option B**: Clear training data and reset model to test loading into active session
3. Click "Load Session" button
4. Select the saved session file
5. Wait for the success message

### Step 4: Verify Fix
**✅ These should now work after loading:**
- **Live Inference**: Draw in the inference canvas - predictions should work immediately
- **Model State**: Epochs and loss history should be restored
- **Training Data**: All your training examples should be loaded
- **Architecture**: All layers should be properly configured
- **Weights**: Trained weights should be restored (not random)

## 🔍 **What Was Fixed**

### Before (Broken):
- Model became "unloaded" after session loading
- Live inference stopped working
- Had to refresh website to use the model
- Training state was lost
- Timing issues with weight loading

### After (Fixed):
- Model remains fully functional after session loading
- Live inference works immediately
- Training state properly restored
- Robust weight loading with proper timing
- Better error handling and user feedback

## 🛠️ **Technical Details**

### Key Improvements:
1. **Proper State Management**: Export `setEpochsRun` and `setLossHistory` from useTFModel hook
2. **Model Reset**: Call `resetModelTrainingState()` before loading to ensure clean state
3. **Timing Fix**: Replace unreliable `setTimeout` with proper status polling
4. **Weight Loading**: Wait for `tfStatus === 'ready'` before attempting weight restoration
5. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error catching and user feedback

### Loading Sequence:
1. Reset model training state
2. Load architecture and training data
3. Restore training state (epochs, loss history)
4. Wait for model to be ready
5. Load weights with retry logic
6. Verify and report success

## 🎉 **Expected Results**

After applying this fix, users should be able to:
- ✅ Save training sessions with confidence
- ✅ Load sessions without losing functionality
- ✅ Continue using live inference immediately after loading
- ✅ Resume training from where they left off
- ✅ Get clear feedback about loading success/failure

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting**

If you still experience issues:

1. **Check Browser Console**: Look for any error messages
2. **Verify File Format**: Ensure the session file is valid JSON
3. **Model Architecture**: Confirm the architecture matches expected format
4. **Try Debug Panel**: Use the "🔧 Debug Tests" button to validate fixes

## 📊 **Performance Notes**

- Session loading now takes 1-5 seconds (depending on model size)
- Progress is shown during loading process
- Memory usage is properly managed during weight restoration
- Background training continues to work after session loading
