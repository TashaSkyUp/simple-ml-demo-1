# Session Management Guide

## Overview

The Interactive CNN Trainer includes powerful session management capabilities that allow you to save and restore complete training sessions, including your model architecture, training data, and most importantly - your trained model weights. This feature is fully implemented and working in the current version.

## What Gets Saved

When you save a session, the following data is preserved:

### üèóÔ∏è **Network Architecture**
- Complete layer configuration (Conv2D, MaxPooling, Dense, Reshape, etc.)
- Layer parameters (filters, kernel sizes, activation functions, etc.)
- Layer order and connections

### üìä **Training Data**
- All collected samples (drawings or camera captures)
- Associated labels for each sample
- Timestamps for data collection tracking

### üß† **Trained Model Weights** ‚≠ê **NEW!**
- Complete neural network weights and biases
- All layer parameters learned during training
- Preserves your model's learning progress

### üìà **Training Metrics**
- Number of epochs completed
- Complete loss history curve
- Training progress indicators

## How to Save a Session

1. **Train Your Model**: Collect data and train your CNN as usual
2. **Click "Save Session"**: Located in the Training Controls panel (blue button)
3. **Wait for Processing**: The system will serialize model weights (may take a few seconds)
4. **Download Automatically**: A timestamped JSON file will be downloaded

### Save Process Details
- **Progress Feedback**: Button shows "Saving..." during weight serialization and becomes disabled
- **Automatic Naming**: Files are named `cnn_session_YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.json`
- **Comprehensive Summary**: Alert message shows detailed breakdown of what was saved:
  - Architecture: Number of layers
  - Training data: Number of samples
  - Trained weights: Included/Not available
  - Epochs: Number completed
  - Loss history: Number of data points

## How to Load a Session

1. **Click "Load Session"**: Located in the Training Controls panel (purple button)
2. **Select File**: Choose a previously saved session JSON file (.json files only)
3. **Automatic Processing**: 
   - Architecture loads immediately
   - Training data loads immediately
   - Model reinitializes with new architecture
   - Weights restore after model is ready (with automatic retry mechanism)
4. **Continue Training**: Pick up exactly where you left off

### Load Process Details
- **Validation**: File structure is validated before loading (checks for required arrays)
- **Graceful Fallback**: If weights fail to load, model uses random weights but continues
- **Status Updates**: Alert messages indicate what was successfully restored
- **Smart Retry**: System waits up to 5 seconds for model to be ready before loading weights

## Session File Format

Session files are human-readable JSON with the following structure:

```json
{
  "layers": [
    {
      "id": 1640995200000,
      "type": "conv2d",
      "filters": 32,
      "kernelSize": 3,
      "activation": "relu",
      "inputShape": [28, 28, 1]
    }
    // ... more layers
  ],
  "trainingData": [
    {
      "image": [0.1, 0.2, 0.3, ...],
      "label": "circle",
      "timestamp": 1640995200000
    }
    // ... more samples
  ],
  "modelWeights": [
    {
      "shape": [3, 3, 1, 32],
      "data": [0.123, -0.456, 0.789, ...]
    }
    // ... weights for each layer
  ],
  "epochsRun": 25,
  "lossHistory": [2.3026, 1.8456, 1.2345, ...]
}
```

## Best Practices

### üìÅ **File Organization**
- **Timestamp Names**: Files are automatically timestamped for easy sorting
- **Descriptive Storage**: Create folders for different projects or experiments
- **Version Control**: Keep multiple saves during long training sessions

### üíæ **When to Save**
- **After Successful Training**: When you achieve good performance
- **Before Architecture Changes**: Save current state before experimenting
- **Regular Checkpoints**: During long training sessions
- **Before Closing Browser**: Always save your work!

### üîÑ **Sharing Sessions**
- **Complete Portability**: Sessions work across different devices and browsers
- **Collaboration**: Share trained models with teammates or students
- **Reproducibility**: Others can load your exact training state

## Technical Details

### Model Weight Serialization
- **TensorFlow.js Integration**: Uses native `model.getWeights()` and `model.setWeights()`
- **Memory Management**: Properly disposes of tensor objects to prevent memory leaks
- **Format**: Weights stored as arrays with shape information for reconstruction

### Error Handling
- **Graceful Degradation**: If weights fail to load, model continues with random initialization
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and success confirmations
- **Validation**: File structure validation before processing

### Performance Considerations
- **Async Operations**: Weight saving/loading is asynchronous to prevent UI blocking
- **File Size**: Large models may create substantial JSON files (expected behavior)
- **Loading Time**: Complex models may take a few seconds to fully restore

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to save model weights"**
- Ensure model has been initialized and trained
- Check browser memory availability
- Try saving after training completion

**"Failed to restore trained weights"**
- File may be corrupted or from incompatible version
- Model will continue with random weights
- Architecture and training data should still load

**Large File Sizes**
- Expected for complex models with many parameters
- Consider training simpler architectures if storage is limited
- Weights data scales with model complexity

**Slow Loading**
- Large models take time to deserialize weights
- Wait for "Session loaded successfully" message
- Don't interrupt the loading process

### Getting Help

If you encounter persistent issues:
1. Check browser console for detailed error messages
2. Verify JSON file isn't corrupted (should be valid JSON)
3. Try loading with a fresh browser session
4. Ensure your browser supports modern JavaScript features
5. Check that the session file contains the required fields (layers, trainingData)
6. Report issues with session file examples if possible

## Advanced Usage

### Manual Session Editing
Since sessions are JSON files, advanced users can:
- Modify training data programmatically  
- Adjust architecture parameters
- Combine training data from multiple sessions
- Analyze weight distributions

‚ö†Ô∏è **Warning**: Manual editing may break session compatibility. Always backup original files.

### Batch Processing
For researchers or advanced users:
- Scripts can process multiple session files
- Extract weights for analysis in other tools
- Automate session validation and conversion
