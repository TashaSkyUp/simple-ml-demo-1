  - Ctrl+1: Network Architecture
  - Ctrl+2: Data Collection  
  - Ctrl+3: Training & Session Management
  - Ctrl+4: GPU Performance
  - Ctrl+5: Neural Network Visualization

### Visual Indicators

#### Section States
- **Expanded Sections**: Show full content with fade-in animation
- **Collapsed Sections**: Show only header with reduced opacity
- **Interactive Badges**: Display relevant metrics (counts, status, performance)

#### Training Status Indicators
- **Training Progress**: Shows epochs completed during active training
- **GPU Status**: Displays current backend (WebGL/CPU) and performance metrics
- **Data Collection**: Shows number of collected samples

## üì± Mobile Optimization

- **Per-Tab Settings**: Section states are maintained for each interface tab

### Accessibility Features
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with visual focus indicators
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels and roles
- **High Contrast**: Clear visual hierarchy and contrast ratios
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus handling

## üöÄ Performance Features

### Lazy Loading
- **Collapsed Sections**: Content not rendered when collapsed
- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced DOM complexity
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transforms

### Responsive Images
- **Adaptive Loading**: Content scales based on container size
- **Efficient Rendering**: Collapsed sections reduce DOM complexity
- **Smooth Animations**: Hardware-accelerated CSS transitions

## üìä Usage Tips

### For Small Screens (Mobile/Tablet)
1. **Collapse Unused Sections**: Keep only the section you're currently working on open
2. **Use Keyboard Shortcuts**: Quick navigation with Ctrl+1-5 (on devices with keyboards)
3. **Tab Navigation**: Switch between Training and Inference tabs for different workflows
4. **Priority Focus**: Focus on one task at a time for better performance

### For Large Screens (Desktop)
1. **Keep Key Sections Open**: Take advantage of screen real estate
2. **Multi-Task**: Monitor training progress while adjusting architecture
3. **Three-Column Layout**: Architecture, data collection, and training controls visible simultaneously

### For Ultra-Wide Screens
1. **Full Layout**: All sections can be open without scrolling
2. **Live Monitoring**: Watch all metrics and visualizations at once
3. **Parallel Workflows**: Architecture design and training can happen side-by-side

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sections Won't Toggle**
- Check if JavaScript is enabled in your browser
- Try keyboard shortcuts (Ctrl+1-5) as an alternative
- Refresh page to reset section states
- Clear localStorage if settings appear corrupted

**Layout Issues**
- Browser zoom level might affect responsive breakpoints
- Try refreshing the page to reset layout
- Ensure browser window is large enough for multi-column layout
- Check browser compatibility (requires modern browser with CSS Grid support)

**Performance Problems**
- Close unnecessary sections to reduce DOM complexity and improve performance
- Switch to CPU backend if WebGL causes issues
- Clear browser cache and restart if memory usage is high
- Use the GPU Performance section to monitor and optimize performance

### Browser Compatibility
- **Recommended**: Chrome 90+, Firefox 90+, Safari 14+, Edge 90+
- **Required Features**: CSS Grid, Flexbox, Local Storage, Modern JavaScript
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation on older browsers
